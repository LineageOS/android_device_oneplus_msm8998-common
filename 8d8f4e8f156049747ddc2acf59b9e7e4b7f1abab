      "message": "The fixes for https://android-review.googlesource.com/q/bug:241044073 removed the support for creating signed boot images. Due to this Lineage 21 images for OnePlus 5 and 5T can no longer be used with locked bootloader. This PR brings support for the same.\n\nTechnically we can just revert the needed changes, but I was not sure if booting Lineage on locked bootloader was supported for other devices or not. Hence I have added it back using the BOARD_CUSTOM_BOOTIMG_MK functionality",
